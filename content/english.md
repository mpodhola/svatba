# Dear dear friends, parents, relatives, and acquaintances,

**We would like to invite you to our wedding day. We are getting married on August 24th in Prague, at our place in Vršovice at Planet ZA.**

## How will it all unfold?

The ceremony will be at two in the afternoon, so let's gather an hour earlier to greet each other. After the ceremony, there will be the customary hugging and congratulations, followed by a toast and a speech. The speech will be given by family members, but if any of our friends would like to say something as well, please don't hesitate, it would bring us great joy. Just please send a message beforehand, so we can count on you.

Then there will be a moment to relax, where you can grab a bite from the buffet, have a drink, and chat with friends. We'll cut the cake around five, followed by dancing and a party. The festivities will last until ten in the evening, with beer, wine, and soft drinks available. The bartenders will also be happy to prepare other drinks for you.

At ten in the evening, the wedding day officially ends and the afterparty begins, so make sure to stay for it, as it will be a fantastic ride. The afterparty will move indoors, and after the wedding kegs and wines are finished, paid drinks will be available at the bar at Planet ZA, please note this and bring cash or cards with you.

## Food and drinks:

We'll provide food, mainly catering to vegetarians, but meat-eaters won't be offended either. The food will be served buffet-style, starting after all the lovely official parts of the wedding day, so please keep in mind that if you come hungry, food will be served sometime in the afternoon.

For dessert, you can look forward to cutting the wedding cake. You'll even get to dance with the cake, so it'll be a relaxed affair.

Beer, soft drinks, and wine will be available throughout the day. Other drinks will be available for purchase at the bar. In the evening at the afterparty, all drinks will be paid for after consuming the stocked supplies.

## Gifts?

We appreciate gifts, of course, but please consider that we already have plenty and don't need any more things, as we can provide ourselves with experiences. And as for what makes a good wedding gift - a blender? We'd be happy to buy that ourselves, so we'd prefer contributions towards this party instead.

## Location:

Planet ZA is a space within the Ankali club. It's an inner block accessible from Na Louži street. The easiest way to get here is by tram 6, 7, or 19 to the Bohemians stop, and then about 5 minutes on foot, or tram 22, 13 to Čechovo náměstí and then about 3 minutes on foot.

If you'd like to minimize your carbon footprint and come by car, there's plenty of parking on the street, especially if there's no football match at Slavia. Parking is free on weekends, so you can leave your car there until Sunday.

## Who to bring along:

The invitation is valid for specific couples, families, and of course, your children too. The venue isn't entirely child-proof, but we'll have Bertička here, so we'll try to make a corner somewhere for them to have fun too. Please just leave your furry friends at home, as we'll have one there already, and we don't want a barking wedding, thanks.
