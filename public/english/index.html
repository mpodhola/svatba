<p style="text-align: center;">Dear dear friends, parents, relatives, and acquaintances.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We would like to invite you to our wedding day. We will be getting married on August 24, 2024, in Prague, at our place in Vršovice at Planet ZA</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>How will it all unfold?</p>
<p>The ceremony will commence at two in the afternoon, so let&rsquo;s gather an hour earlier to greet each other.</p>
<p>Following the ceremony, there will be the traditional hugging and congratulations, followed by a toast and speeches. The speeches will be given by family members, but if any of our friends would like to say something as well, please don&rsquo;t hesitate, it would bring us great joy. Just please send a message if you plan to do so, so we can include you in the schedule.</p>
<p>Afterward, there will be a moment to relax, where you can enjoy some refreshments from the buffet, have a drink, and chat with friends. We will cut the cake around five o&rsquo;clock, followed by dancing and partying. The festivities will continue until ten in the evening.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock, the official wedding day ends, and the afterparty begins. You are all invited to stay as it will be an amazing DJ set with surprises. The afterparty will move indoors, and after finishing the wedding barrels and wine, paid drinks will be available at the Planet ZA bar. Please take note of this and bring cash or cards with you.</p>
<p>1:00 PM MEETUP AT PLANET ZA</p>
<p>2:00 PM CEREMONY</p>
<p>3:00 PM TOASTS AND SPEECHES</p>
<p>5:30 PM CAKE CUTTING</p>
<p>6:30 PM FIRST DANCE AND DANCING</p>
<p>10:00 PM AFTERPARTY</p>
<p>Program subject to change.</p>
<p><strong>FOOD AND DRINK</strong></p>
<p>We will provide food that caters to vegetarians and won&rsquo;t offend carnivores. Food will be served buffet-style and will commence after all the formal parts of the wedding day. So please note that if you arrive hungry, food will be served sometime in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The wedding cake will be served in the afternoon as a sweet treat. You&rsquo;ll have the chance to dance off the cake, so it&rsquo;s all in good spirits.</p>
<p>There will be beer, soft drinks, and wine available throughout the day. Other drinks will be available for purchase at the bar. All drinks at the afterparty will be paid for after consuming the provided supply.</p>
<p><strong>GIFTS</strong></p>
<p>We appreciate gifts, of course, but please consider that we already have plenty, and we can manage experiences on our own. As for wedding gifts - a blender, perhaps? We&rsquo;d prefer to choose it ourselves. So, thanks for the gifts, but we would most appreciate contributions to this party.</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION</strong></p>
<p>Planet ZA is a space within the Ankali club. It&rsquo;s an inner block accessible from Na Louži street.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.mapy.cz/s/felutesobo">The address is Na Louži 7, 101 00 Prague</a>
10-Vršovice.
The entrance gates will be marked.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get here is by tram 6, 7, 19 to the Bohemians stop, and then about a 5-minute walk, or by tram 22, 13 to Čechovo náměstí and then about a 3-minute walk.</p>
<p>If you choose to leave a carbon footprint and come by car, there are plenty of parking spaces on the street unless there&rsquo;s a Slavia football match. Parking is free on weekends, so you can leave your car there until Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>WHO AND WHAT TO BRING</strong></p>
<p>The invitation is valid for specific couples, families, and, of course, your children. The space isn&rsquo;t entirely child-proofed, but we&rsquo;ll have Bertička here, so we&rsquo;ll try to set up a kiddie corner so they can have fun too. Please leave your furry friends at home.</p>
<p><strong>DRESS CODE</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wedding, so dressing up a bit is appropriate, but it&rsquo;s important to be comfortable. The space is mostly concrete, so any shoes will do. It&rsquo;s important that you can dance comfortably in them.</p>
<p><strong>PHOTOGRAPHY</strong></p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be an official photographer at the wedding. We&rsquo;ll take two photos with family right after the ceremony, and other photos will be taken with mobile phones, instax, etc. Please feel free to take photos as well and then send them to us. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACTS</strong></p>
<p>If anything isn&rsquo;t clear or if you just want to chat, call or write. On the wedding day, it&rsquo;s better to call Adam or Peta.</p>
